			<p class="pb-5">I'm a committed Graduate Software Developer seeking for my first professional opportunity to collaborate in a team. Born and studied my Bachelor of Information Technology + Software Development Degree in Australia, currently located in the UK, Suffolk.</p>
			<p class="pb-5">I've been designing and programming small computer games for enjoyment and learning ever since I was 10 years old. This has strongly built up my core programming foundation, so learning new languages has never been so easier.</p>
      <p>Although I may not currently know every programming language or hold every development skill, <b>I'm very eager and passionate to learn new programming languages and technologies.</b></p>
